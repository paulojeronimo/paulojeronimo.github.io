A Git repository that always contains a single commit and only temporary files.

So, don't expect that you can make a clone of this repository thinking you'll
pull it later because that won't work.

The files generated in this repository are accessible through the URL
https://paulojeronimo.com/tmp/.

The SHA256 of the temporary files stored here keeps alive (and constantly
updated) in https://paulojeronimo.com/tmp-history/files.txt.

The link:publish-to-gh-pages.sh[] script is responsible for recreating this
repository every time it is called.

The link:generate-random-file.sh[] script is responsible for creating a file
with a random and unique name in this directory. Possibly, the contents of this
file will be encrypted via https://gnupg.org/[GPG].
