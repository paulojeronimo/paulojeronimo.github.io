#1 OK -> Build the entire site with a unique call to build.sh
Fix: a call to './posts/build.sh all' should also call './posts/build.sh index.adoc'
OK -> (Related to &1): Fix the current order to call the scripts to build the entire site which is:
----
./posts/build.sh index.{yaml,adoc}; ./build.sh ./posts/build.sh all
----   
If the README.adoc in post is more recent than index.yaml, then we need to rebuild this last file and generate index.adoc again
