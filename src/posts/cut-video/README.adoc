*{PauloJeronimo} in {Brasilia} on {PostDate}*:
include::abstract.adoc[]

Please, also note that I created this article post to use for recording
my first video in English.
I am a Brazilian, developing in {Bash} since the early 2000s, but I
never recorded any video (in English) about this.
So I decided to create a new Bash script, and a related article, to use
as input for recording this video.

[[cut-video]]
== The cut-video script

The `cut-video` script is a *55 lines {Bash} script* that I wrote to do
video cuttings and compression using {ffmpeg} and {HandBrakeCLI}.

NOTE: *55 is a "magic" Fibonacci number* and I love this kind of
numbers!
See another project that I developed (in JavaScript/ React):
{uri-fibonacci-app}.

<<details,I will explain the code below>>.
In order to do this, I put some tags inside the code (using comments in
the format "# ref-string") and will explain all of them.

[source,bash]
.Here is the entire content of the script:
----
include::cut-video[]
----

The more recent version of this script, maybe different and with more
features, is also available in my `dotfiles` GitHub repository, here:
{uri-github-paulojeronimo-dotfiles}.

[[details]]
== Details in the cut-video script

.the first line
[%collapsible]
====
In most of all Unix scripts, the first line contains an interpreter
directive called <<shebang>>. +
It "is like a comment" in the first line but, actually, it is a
character sequence `#! ...` used by the program loader to interpret the
rest of the script. +
The loader executes the specified interpreter, passing it as an argument
to the path initially used when attempting to run the script. +
See <<shebang,more details in the references section>>.
====

.the comment lines in the header
[%collapsible]
====
Sometimes I like to write the header of my scripts using another
structured text.
In this case, it is written in {YAML} format.
You can test this by typing the following command on your terminal
(assuming you have {yq} installed):

[source,bash]
----
yq -o json <(sed -n '2,5p' cut-video | sed 's,^# ,,g')
----

This will be the output:

[source,json]

.ref-clips_file

The _clips_file_ variable is file name, with a *Comma Separated Virgula
(CSV)* content, that will be used to determine the positions where the
file _original-file_ (a link to the file that will be processed) will be
cutted.

Here is a sample content for this file:

[source,csv]
----
include::clips.csv[]
----
====

.ref-video_var
[%collapsible]
====
The _video_var_ variable will be configured to get last part of the
name of the current directory (indicated by the `$PWD`), and will be
used to compose the name of the generated file in the cutting (made by
{ffmpeg}) and also in the compression (made by {HandBrakeCLI}).

.ref-go_ahead
[%collapsible]
====
The code below this comment will vefify if we have the conditions to run
this script satisfied.

The first validation (*ref-command-isnt-in-path*) will verify if the
required commands ({ffmpeg} and {HandBrakeCLI}) are available in the
`PATH`.

The second validation (*ref-file-not-found*) will check if the files
(`$clips_file` and `original-video`) are present on the current
directory.

If one of these conditions aren't satisfied, the `go_ahead` variable
will be `false`.
In the *ref-abort* block, executed if `$go_ahead` is false, the script
will print an aborting message and terminate its execution with an error
code 1.

.ref-read-csv

This `while` will loop through the contents of the CSV (`$clips_file`).

== Testing

In order to do the next tests with {cut-video}, you can copy and paste
the following commands directly into your shell.
I'll be using two environments in these tests: {Termux} and Linux.

=== Test 1

To follow the steps that I will show you, you will need the following
tools installed:

. {yt-dlp}
. {FFmpeg}

I will demonstrate the commands below by doing this on my own mobile
phone and using {Termux}.

[NOTE]
====
To replicate the commands inside Termux, like me, first you will need to
run the following script on it:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
bash <(curl -sSL TODO(url)/termux-setup.sh)
----
====

Let's download {uri-youtube-mettalica-on-the-piano}[a video containing
some piano musics that I like^] (in low quality definition to speed up
our test) and create a link called `original-file` to it:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
d=/tmp/mettalica-on-the-piano; rm -rf $d; mkdir $d && cd $_ && \
yt-dlp -f 160 '{uri-youtube-mettalica-on-the-piano}' && \
ln -sf "$(echo *.mp4)" original-video
----

After that, we'll download the {cut-video} script and make it
executable:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
s=cut-video; curl -sSL TODO(url)/$s -o $s; chmod +x $s
----

Before calling this script we need to create a file called `clips.csv`
with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cat <<'EOF'>clips.csv
00:00:00,00:05:33,$video - 1.nothing-else-matters.mp4
00:05:34,00:12:43,$video - 2.master-of-pupets.mp4
00:12:44,00:18:09,$video - 3.fade-to-black.mp4
00:18:10,00:23:18,$video - 4.the-unforgiven.mp4
00:23:19,00:30:20,$video - 5.one.mp4
EOF
----

We can now call execute the {cut-video} script:

[source,bash]
----
./cut-video
----

If everything goes weel, the tree of files created in this testing will
be equals to the output shown in command below:

----
include::tree-output.txt[]
----

=== Test 2

*[red]#TODO#* -> Finish this topic.

To follow this test we will need another environment and more some
addional tools installed:

. {Docker}
. {HandBrakeCLI}

----
cat <<'EOF'>.cut-video
# vim: syntax=bash

mkv_compression=true
echo .cut-video loaded!
EOF
----
