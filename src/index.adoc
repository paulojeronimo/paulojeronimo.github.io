Hi! *I'm Paulo Jerônimo*.
Welcome to my *very very simple website* (almost completely text-based and written in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc format]).

I work as a *Software Architect/ Developer* and, sometimes, as a *DevOps* guy.
I have some skills and experience (around 20 years).

Currently, I work for a software company, in Portugal.
I'm also building a startup focused on developing solutions to the sportive area.

I'm an amateur triathlete practicing triathlon *daily* to get more healthy and life quality.
I have *three (3) finished https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon[Ironman]*.

If you want to read more about me and the things that I'm doing, see my {cv}.
